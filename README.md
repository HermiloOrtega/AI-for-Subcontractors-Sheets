# üßæ Applying AI for Subcontractors Sheets

## üß≠ Overview
**Applying AI for Subcontractors Sheets** is a Microsoft Power Automate project that automates the processing of structured subcontractor documentation uploaded to SharePoint. Using a trained AI Builder model, the flow extracts key fields from each document and sends them to an Excel file. The extracted data is then visualized in a Power BI dashboard embedded within the **Quattrofy** platform.

## üí° Idea & Concept
This project was developed to streamline and centralize subcontractor data collection. Manual tracking of vendor-provided services and associated costs was prone to delay and inconsistency. By using AI and automation, subcontractor data is captured in near real-time and made available for business reporting and decision-making.

## ‚ú® Features & Functionality
- **Automated Trigger** when a subcontractor sheet is uploaded to SharePoint
- **AI-Powered Extraction** using a trained model to detect:
  - Project name
  - Superintendent who received the sheet
  - Type of services performed
  - Associated costs and totals
  - Vendor/Subcontractor information
- **Excel Integration** to store extracted data
- **Power BI Dashboard** integration for:
  - Filtering by project, vendor, or superintendent
  - Viewing service and cost summaries
  - Identifying high-cost vendors over time
